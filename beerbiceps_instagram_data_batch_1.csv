"“Mama I made it to Forbes!” ♥️🥹

Made my mom proud today. Nothing else matters. 

True, raw emotions caught on camera thanks to my profession of vlogging. 

I do have some learnings to share :
- Manifestation & visualisation is cool. But don’t let it take over your mind. 

- I manifested this. But every year that it didn’t happen, made me want to go even harder in the paint! More ferocity. More work. More sacrifices.

- After this clip got recorded, I broke down. Out of happiness and gratitude. But also out of pity for the younger version of me.

- I never celebrated small wins in the chase for one of these type of goals. Today all that will change. 

- If you’re young and ambitious, know that you can never condtrol thde results. You can only control your honesty & integrity in your profession.

- Just do your work to the best of your abilities. And don’t be harsh on yourself if you don’t get to where you wish to be. Try harder the next time but also enjoy each day of your career.

- From today onwards, believe it or not, things have changed. I feel relieved. I feel grateful. I feel free. Only 1 goal left. Without a timeline on it - Build a unicorn.

- The unicorn will be built. But I’m sure as heck going to ENJOY the process. Without a sense of, LETS GET THERE RIGHT NOW. 

- As long as I give it my all, I know God has my back. 

Karmanyava Dhikaraste Maa Phaleshu Kadachana - Only be attached to your sense of hard work. Not to the results that the hard work will bring.

If your parents are proud of you, that’s the biggest achievement.",370938,1895774,3640,1895774,Reel,beerbiceps
"Arjuna : 

1. When you're focusing on the goal, may your eyes trail nowhere else. 

2. Despite immense success & ability, kneel in front of God. 

3. Understand that your success or failure contains many factors that are beyond your control. Be humble and give every day your best.

4. When choosing between ""infinite power of any kind"" & God, choose God. 

5. Lead from the front, lead by example. 

6. Challenge yourself to be incrementally better every day.

7. Be ready to die for your family.

8. Be abled enough to protect them at all costs.

9. Chase excellence so hard, that your effort becomes your greatest legacy.

10. Be the reason that your side wins any war, even when the odds are stacked against you. Believe in yourself.

Karmanyava Dhikaraste Ma Phaleshu Kadachana : Your results are never in your hand, only your efforts are.

"Dear soul reading this, 
According to numerology, 2024 has been a year governed by Saturn. 

Saturn tests two aspects of your existence : 
1. Your ability to work hard through storms.
2. Your ability to stay humble through glory.

Saturn is a task master. Saturn is an examiner.

It's not been an easy year for me either. I have put my head down and worked through it all.

Some times, while my head was down and working... my eyes teared up with the pressure of being an adult. 

Some times while my head was down and working... God gave me moments to smile & breathe.

It's been a year that's tested me to my last degree of resistance.

It's a year that's taught me : Faith and belief can overcome the false storms of what we call ""suffering""

My knee injury was a gift as much as my national award was.

My poor mental health was a gift as much as public adulation was.

Life's purpose is to grow. Often through the dungeons of suffering as much as through the dungeons of success.

Get even healthier this year.
Meditate deeply this year.
Pursue peace this year.

But whatever you do, believe that God is with you through every step.

Happy 2025, have a blessed one!

2025 - Year of ""Mars""

Pour your intensity into the speed and strength of your work.
Now overcome your own demons.
Now grow more easily.

"Merry Christmas to you all, from Goa. It's been the most eventful Christmas of my life. 

Gonna be very vulnerable in this write up.

We're perfectly fine & well now. But yesterday at 6:00 pm or so, my girlfriend and I had to be rescued from a bit of a situation.

We both love swimming in the open ocean. I've been doing this since I was a kid. 

But yesterday we got swept away by an underwater current. 
This has happened to me before but I've never been alongside a companion.

It's easy to swim out of one alone. It's very hard to pull someone out with you.

After a 5-10 minute struggle, we called for help and were promptly rescued by a family of 5 swimming nearby.

We're both good swimmers but the fury of nature is such that it WILL test your limits at some point.

A casual, fun dip in the waves was interrupted by an underwater current that toppled both of us. The next thing we knew was that we were both struggling to stay afloat.

There was a point during the ordeal where I swallowed a lot of water and started fading away a little bit. That's when I decided to shout for help.

Deep gratitude to the family of the IPS officer husband and IRS officer wife who saved us both.

This experience left us feeling both blank as well as grateful. We felt the protection of God throughout the incident.

As we moved into today's Christmas, we're simply full of gratitude for being alive.

Almost feel like this one life experience has changed my perspective towards living.

Writing this because I've always shared these moments with you all. Full of emotion and gratitude today. A deep thank you and big hugs to each one of you reading this!

Last evening, I decided to call my brother @brother.salvador to convey the Christmas Eve incident. He performed a prayer for us where we thanked Lord Jesus Christ as well as the God above us. 

This has been a very very memorable Goa holiday for me. From discovering secret Murtis at @aliladiwagoa to touching the life-death barrier.

I guess 2025 is going to be more blessed than ever.

We lived for a reason!

Merry Christmas to you all and to your families. Thank you God, for life! 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻♥️",416102,,2218,,Carousel,beerbiceps
"Dubai dump...

2024 has been painted by challenges & tests from God.

Weirdly it's also been the best career year yet.

This trip marks the end of a very difficult, but rewarding chapter.

At the start of this year, I'd aimed to travel abroad twice for the sake of @theranveershowpodcast.

This was our 3rd podcasting trip of the year. 2024 has been better than we aimed for.

There's only a few days in the whole year when I allow myself to ACTUALLY, TRULY, FULLY feel proud of myself.

Today is that day.

On most other days, even on the fanciest, most flashy days... there's a part of me looking down on my own achievements.

Nothing seems to be enough. Nothing gives me true happiness. No awards, no career highlights, NOTHING.

I am wired to not celebrate. Because I know how much failing has hurt past versions of me.

The less you celebrate success, the less that failure stings when it inevitably happens.

I don't think that this is a healthy mentality for the long term.
But right now, this mindset helps tremendously.

Every year I compete with only one person. 
Me from the previous year.

Fortunately, I've won for 9 years straight. 

Perhaps this year we win the battle of ""work-life-balance"" as well.

Life shouldn't be all about work. 
Intense years should be embraced.
Breezy years should be embraced.

Now we enter our 10th year.

I'm prepared to win & not celebrate again throughout 2025.

But today, we celebrate fully.

Today is a good day because my 2024 shoot schedule comes to an end.

2024 year end :

The goals that once seemed like dreams, have now become possible.

Thank you to my beautiful team @teambeerbiceps.

Thank you to my 🌻

The Ranveer Show's UK Tour has brought us to this stunning city.

And now...

Horror returns on TRS.

Very few travel experiences have sunk in as deeply as this one.

We got here to shoot a couple of podcasts. 
But also discovered that this is one of England's oldest cities. 

It also happens to be one of the most haunted. 

And therefore, we decided to seek out some occultists here.

I live for ghost walks and horror themed experiences when I travel. Shot some edgy podcasts here. Can't wait to put them out! 

It's not easy to travel more than 7500 km away from home and shoot high quality podcasts. My brothers @akshattiiwari & @aayushtiiwari are with me on this legendary tour. We're making magic happen in this corner of the world.

For @theranveershowpodcast, we've already shot 9 epic episodes in the UK. A few more to go before we return to the motherland.

But TRS has GONE GLOBAL. And we will only continue to create content for a world audience!

"I've worked my socks off for what I have today.

It's not like we started the podcast and all of sudden we were national news.

Let's rewind a bit :
- Began working as a fitness trainer (went to people's houses to earn money).
- Ran a couple of YouTube channels for 4-5 years before we began the podcast.
- Cofounded a talent management firm called @monkentertainment out of a garage.
- Scaled my content career and business career simultaneously for years.
- Published content every second day for 10 years now. 
- Shot and released close to 900 podcasts.
- Cofounded a profitable tech business called @levelsupermind.
- Going global in YEAR 10 of my journey.

I've lost friends, romances, money, mental health & simplicity trying to get here.

Is this journey meant for everyone? Hell no. I've lived a deeply unbalanced life and I wouldn't wish this reality upon anyone.

I think life should be much more about love, family & spiritual growth than it should be about material progress.

But at this point, I know a story is being written for the history textbooks. I know that what my team @teambeerbiceps is building at this point, will be a case study for future generations.

I can't stop. At least not for a while.

Not everyone is born to be entrepreneurial. This reel is for the misfits, the dreamers & the ones that society calls ""crazy"".

At countless junctures, I've been discouraged, cancelled, hated upon & judged. 

My perpetual lesson has been : Keep carrying on. Think, execute, learn, ask & grow.

If life is hard and the goals are big, you're doing great my friend. Carry on. The suffering of today becomes the strength of tomorrow.

Multiple moments from this trip left me feeling liquidised.

Somewhere between the plane of humans & angels & light.

I think this is going to be the place I choose to settle in and raise my family. 

Of course it would be great to continue my career from up here. 

But truth be told, the mountains have a way of leaving you feeling deeply contented.

I've worked really really really hard in the 10 years leading up to 2025.

I've accomplished everything I set out to accomplish. I finally feel (mostly) satiated.

At this point I'm only accepting the city life for the sake of the people who chose to work with me.

We have to see our mission through and I jolly well know that we will. Everyone who has put in the years will build generational wealth for their families.

But as for me, I just want to get lost in these other worldly colours. 

One day a lemony gold sunset to kiss me goodbye.

The other day, a saturated rainbow to make me feel like a 4 year old again. 

Then a moment of deep rest (perhaps ego death), by the side of a sapphire blue stream. 

And finally, a reminder from a mountain Goddess (this time Chamunda Maa)... telling me, ""Son, give this girl with you the best that you have to offer...""

We return to the city life albeit for 12 hours. 
Tomorrow, we go to Singapore. 

Age 31 leaves another 9 years of war ahead of me.

Life can't be about making money forever.

Truth be told, I've been going through a very difficult year.

I don't get too much time to myself and step out very rarely. When I'm out in public, I've reached a stage where I wish to be as private as possible. 

If I'm out with my mum or girlfriend, I simply wish to hold their bags and be Ranveer. Not beerbiceps...

Of course I'm grateful to anyone who comes up and conveys love. But I've also had many situations where people come up and convey criticism, judgement or generally speaking : dark energy.

I guess when one makes it mainstream, the experience of life gets altered slightly...

No complaints, this is what I signed up for. I can't have a normal experience of life if I'm releasing 4 podcasts a week 😂

Khwaab came up to me without any kind of hesitation.

I felt like her presence melted away my tough day, tough year & tough exterior...

The photo you see is my best moment from that day! And quite easily one of the best moments of the year.

Thank you @khwaab__artwani 🤍🤍🤍🤍

In a torrential ocean that I call life, moments like these stabilise the ship that I call my heart...

The other photos are other happy highlights from this past month : 
- my loved ones. 
- some achievements.
- some epic meetings with epic souls.

2024 : One of the toughest years of my life. But life is still joyous.

This year, the skill I worked on the most : Learning to extract maximum happiness from the little joyous moments of life. Mindfulness combined with gratitude combined with imperviousness.

"Thoughts I've had about having children :

1. Perhaps having kids is the 4th most important aspect of a human birth. The others being :
- Spiritual growth.
- Taking care of your parents
- Giving back to society, through your work.

2. I'm sure that the birth of your kids makes you more responsible. But maybe it also makes you relive your childhood. And therefore makes you dive deeper into your own psyche.

3. Spiritual growth is definitely accelerated if you protect & raise a child. Living for the sake of another human being is one of the greatest things that one can do in a human birth.

4. One needs to be financially, spiritually and biologically ready to bring life into this world. Be aware of ""responsibility"", before multiple duties become your reality.

5. Having progeny is your chance at the propulsion of your value system into the future. If your kids make the world a better place, you have done your bit for society. 

6. Considering where world population demographics currently stand, many believe that a couple should produce more than 2 children. Personally I want more than 2 kids. But not at the cost of the quality of fatherhood I can provide. Time will tell...

7. As I age, I love my parents more with every passing year. I also realise that I carry generational trauma & tendencies that I've inherited from my bloodline. Fatherhood will be my test. What am I passing on to the next generation? What tendencies or trauma will be held back from reaching them?

All I can do now is work on being the best version of myself.

---

Every stage of adult life throws new challenges your way.

If you put your mind to it, you'll become better annually.

Study about fatherhood.
Study people's mistakes.
Visualise a warm reality.
Prepare for responsibility.
