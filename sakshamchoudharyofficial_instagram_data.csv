"Sometimes, you realize you are living a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity—one where you meet and interact with a true legend in person. I had the privilege of meeting @kondavishweshwarreddy sir, a distinguished leader who has held prominent roles such as CEO and MD at Wipro HCIT, MD and Director at Citadel, MD and CEO at GE Healthcare, and is currently serving as a Member of Parliament with the BJP.

What fascinated me even more was discovering that, back in 1985—before I was even born—he was a computer science faculty member at the New Jersey Institute of Technology and Essex County College. Engaging with someone of his vast experience is a unique opportunity for learning, and I took full advantage by asking countless questions about his teaching and research. His insight into the future of technology and where humanity is headed is nothing short of extraordinary, and I found myself in complete agreement with his perspectives.

Here’s a quick glimpse of my remarkable experience with him. Thank you, Sir, for your valuable time during @bsidesahmedabad
