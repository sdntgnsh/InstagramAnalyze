"Dharamshala photo dump. 
Aka photos from an inner & outer healing journey.

So much has happened in Dharmsala that I can't possibly put it into a single caption. All I'll say is the following :

Spent years spending long days, 
Waiting to fall asleep,
For my life was harsh & sombre, 
Until I found your mystique...

Now my days are bright & rainy,
A lonely past they do replace.
Now my sleep, no matter how warm.
Is left behind for the prettiest face.

Don't know how to thank you more deeply?
There's so much I wish to give you!
You're the rain & clouds for my dry greenery.
You're the healing my heart feels with you.",309519,,627,,Carousel,beerbiceps

"9 years of BeerBiceps. I now enter my 10th.

At the beginning of my career, my mind was full of ideas, but my heart was full of self doubt. 

It took delusion, shamanic healing, meditation, books, mentors, therapy & luck to get this far.

Somewhere along the way, a false sense of self belief was born in me. I took this ""false self belief"" & executed upon ideas incessantly.

Eventually, my team and I started receiving public adulation as well as growth in numbers. The false self belief turned into real self belief. 

The 9 year journey has perpetually been about execution. Perhaps only to feel better about myself and my capabilities.

The highs have never been celebrated enough or enjoyed completely. That is just how I believe a true warrior should live life. It may simply be a mechanism that protects one over time.

The lows have always been met with grief, heightened discipline & harsher self talk. It has not been an easy journey for me. 

There's definitely a part of my mind and heart that feels torn apart and shredded thanks to the stories of the last 9 years. 

But there's also a part of me that's trying to become more 'still' with time. 

More detached. More process driven.

I tell myself that I'm born to be a GOAT.
I tell myself that I'm born for an infinitely long journey of improvement.
I tell myself that sadness, pain & strife can't pierce my heart.

All of the above 3 lines are lies. 

But they help me carry on. 
They help me focus on the week at hand. 
They help me get better every year.

In my head, I'm already the GOAT I wish to become. In my heart, I feel the bruises of years of negative self talk.

But I carry on with the biggest lesson I learnt from Yogananda Paramhansa : Wake up every morning with faith in God & a warrior spirit. No difficulty can beat the bravery within a spiritual heart.

Samurai mentality : Detachment, constant improvement & ferocity in execution.

Now... it's time to reinvent 🕷️

Thank you for the support over the last 9 years. Onto bigger things.

And then there's ""places that visit your soul.""

For seekers : Ican't even begin to explain what awaits you in Banaras.

The less I say the better. Visit at some point soon. Understand Kaal Bhairav.

All I'll say is this :

Met a smart kid called Kushagra.

He asked me, ""How do people in other cities NOT pray to God? How do they take care of their minds? Don't they feel anxious or weak? I can't imagine a life without this degree of spiritual energy in the air.""

All I said is, ""Brother, you've earned your birth in this city. Consider yourself lucky.""

Been a year that's had extremely high highs. 
Been a year balanced out by terrible lows.

I've come to realise that the questions that matter are :
- Are you getting better at being a human being? 
- Are you becoming a more helpful professional?
- Are you doing your best for your family?
- Are you doing your best for your body?
- Is my girl secure & taken care of?
- Is my team motivated & calm?
- Am I okay battling the world?
- Am I meditating deeper?
- Am I kinder every day?

The answer in all cases should be 'yes' or ""I'm going to get it done.""

"The Buddha was once approached by a man who said, ""I want peace.""

To which the Buddha replied, 
""Remove 'I' to remove the ego. 
Remove 'want' to remove desire. 
You are left with peace.""

Easy in theory, difficult in practice.

But 31 years of living on this planet have taught me a few key lessons :
1. There is no end to life's challenges & aches. Pain is compulsory & suffering is optional.

2. The way your mind processes suffering can be drastically changed if ""spiritual practices"" are a central theme in your life.

3. Meditating, journaling & manifesting are modern & 'cool' alternatives to deeper, more ancient practices.

4. These deeper practices are often rejected by modern humans because they seem to be ""illogical"" or ""orthodox"".

5. Every religion contains evil humans that manipulate other people into accepting twisted forms of rituals under the garb of religion. Knowledge is power. Protect yourself by questioning everything. Move forward with a ritual if it makes sense to YOU.

6. Before jumping to conclusions about rituals of ANY faith, always try experiencing those rituals yourself. Replace judgement with curiosity.

7. Rituals if done with understanding & emotion can be a much more powerful spiritual practice than you'd think!

In this video, my elder brother and mentor @om.dhumatkar is conducting a Hanumana havan for @teambeerbiceps in our office. 

Immensely powerful experience because everyone was vibrating on the same frequency. This 2 hour havan (along with its explanations) left us all feeling purified & enhanced.

Unfortunately I had to sit on a chair because I've torn my knee ligament. But when the heart contains love & respect, the ritual allows for a tiny bending of rules (ideally I should have been on the floor.) 

Love growing older because of experiences like this. 

Healing more every year, Aum Hum Hanumate Namaha!

"About 9 days ago, I tore my ACL during a football match. 

Had only read about how intense a knee injury can feel until I experienced it myself. Happened very randomly when a brother tripped & fell on me during a game.

Heard a pop in my knee and knew immediately that it was something serious. The physical pain kept building up over the next 2-3 days. Fortunately, I began immediate sports Physiotherapy with my saviour @drdivyacures!

Been consistent with my physio routine throughout these 9 days. And the pain is decreasing rapidly.

Currently on the road to recovery and likely dodging the need for a surgery.

I've now realised how important one's knees are. Until you experiences a knee injury (God forbid), you'll never know how mentally challenging this can feel.

Imagine not being able to wear your pants yourself. 
Imagine not being able to sit cross legged. 
Interrupted sleep at night.
Fear induced limping.

It's getting better rapidly but man... my mental health has crumbled in this 1 week. 

Was finally able to sit on a chair for an extended period only yesterday (day 8). Had a deep meditation session after what felt like forever. 

Feeling so much calmer again. Trying to give myself as much positivity as possible. Trying to escape all forms of self pity. And most of all, trying to get back to being in better shape than I ever was 🙏🏻

Life will always throw curve balls your way. Better to stop questioning the lows as early as possible. 

Even better : Respond to low phases with ACTION & with a LEARNING MINDSET. 

Shoutout to everyone who has gone through knee injuries man. This shit fire for all the wrong reasons. 

Shoutout to you if you're going through any physical or mental 'injury'.

Keep fighting, keep rising 🙏🏻♥️",119287,1269288,886,1269288,Reel,beerbiceps
"9 practices that have helped me increase my sense of detachment :

1. Read an immense number of spiritual books. The more wisdom you absorb from the minds of sages, the less society's shortcomings will bother you.
- Autobiography of a Yogi
- Doorways To Light (Krishnananda)
- Ancient Science Of Mantras (Om Swami)
- Any book by Rajarshi Nandy

2. Worked really hard at my material career from early on. The quicker your material needs are taken care of, the sooner your consciousness travels to the realms of what's beyond human limitation.

3. Meditating daily. To begin, use @levelsupermind.

4. Conversations with (much) older people. Eventually you realise that only regrets & relationships matter. And beyond the realms of regret & relationships lies the realm of divinity. In the ultimate end, only your equation with divinity matters.

5. Travelling within India. Yes it's chaotic. Yes, it can be slightly unhygienic. But if you're willing to go beyond these obstacles, you will find consciousness elevating geographies in places like Banaras, Rishikesh, Vrindavan & many more.

6. Not celebrating victories for too long.

7. Constantly visualising a life without :
- My favourite foods.
- My favourite activities.
- My loved ones.
- My physical capabilities.
- Money, success & adulation.

8. Living a life without any intoxication. Giving up alcohol in 2018 was a game changer for me. Giving up meat around the same time was an equally big game changer.

9. Using sadness to write or create. Using happiness to convey joy to others. Perceiving both simply as tools rather than as states of the mind. Because even thoughts should NOT be taken seriously. They are not in your control. 

The only thing in your control is your perception of your thoughts & life.

"9 things to know about ""Siddhis"" : 

1. Some version of ""Siddhis"" or 'divine abilities' is spoken about in every religion in the world. 

2. In the modern day, very few humans adopt a disciplined spiritual path. Hence a very small percentage can even experience powerful ""Siddhis"" being blessed upon them. 

3. In Hinduism, Siddhis are considered roadblocks or obstacles even though they might seem positive on the surface. A ""superpower"" may be exciting in the beginning but its purpose is to test your determination to get to the ultimate goal - Union with the divine. 

4. The more you meditate/pray, the closer you get to achieving the goal you were sent here for. When one is bestowed with a Siddhi, their ego may get inflated. Siddhis are the divine's method of testing your humility and intentions.

5. Siddhis and many aspects of spirituality are beyond the limits of where science has currently reached. Absence of evidence should never mean an evidence of absence. Skeptics will never be convinced about further human evolution. Perhaps they're not yet meant to climb the ladder of spiritual evolution. Step 1 : Be open. 

6. The heightened ""calmness"" or ""focus"" that's scientifically proved by studies on meditation is only the first, tiny version of what ""siddhis"" truly are. 

7. They should not be your motivation. But they will definitely help boost your material prospects. 

8. If you pray/meditate for the sake of material growth, you will likely not gain siddhis because you'll likely not go far up the ladder.

9. Read ""Autobiography of a Yogi"".

"Tore my ACL on Sunday.

Was feeling heaps of self pity & sadness.

No sports for 3 months and lots of therapy to recover...

And just when I was at my lowest, my life as a podcaster woke me up again.

Today we shot with Major DP Singh.

A Kargil War veteran who lost his leg while protecting one of India's posts in South Kashmir.

He's lived without 1 leg (and an old ACL injury on his other leg) for 25 years. 

He's become a marathon runner.

He's achieved multiple world records.

Travels across the country motivating people with stories of hope. 

Absolutely infectious, positive warrior energy.

Really want my knee to recover soon. But days like this don't come your way randomly.

I truly believe that they're sent to you by the universe. To remind you that life is about much more than just your physical (& mental) body's limitations.

Today's strangely poetic meeting was a reminder for me.

I remembered a Bruce Lee quote that I'd go back to a lot while starting off my career :

4. Grateful for my mother but can't see her work any more...

5. My love for family increase every year but my free time possibilities constantly reduce.

6. Marriage will be about lots of free time. Balance then means a bit of imbalance now.

7. I need to get closer to my deity. I need to dive deeper into my spiritual disciplines. More sadhna. More challenging anushthaans.

8. Eventually, God is planning my entire journey. I have to work on constant improvements in humility and routines.

9. I miss my friends. I miss when I had more than just a Sunday to myself... But this is God's plan for 2024.

10. Everything that I prayed for is becoming mine thanks to God's will. Do I even want kids & marriage? Or do I simply want God next? I don't know.

And it's okay to not know.

"This reel isn't just for my mum. 

It's for every mother out there who is sacrificing for the sake of her child. 

One can never value a mother enough until one sees a bit of life. Unfortunately this usually happens post age 25.

So if you're a mom who is working hard for your child's future, just know that ONE day... it's all going to be worth it. 

Thank you for what you do, moms. 

For many of us, we're not able to express it, but every day is Mother's Day. 

For those of you who don't know yet, Sunday is Mother's Day. Do something special for her. 

And for those of you who don't get along with your mum for whatever reason, remember... parents are also growing up along with us. 

Forgive her for what you may hold against her, she knows she's not perfect. 

But she's always going to try to do better. Motherhood is not easy, help her out by simply giving her your TIME regularly. A phone call, a deep conversation, a tight hug.

Go make peace with your mum if that is what your soul is telling you to do. 

But if you're already at peace with her... then please pamper the heck out of her. At least on this weekend.

For me, there's only one reason to give every day my best shot. And that reason is my first love, Dr. Swati Allahbadia.

No joy from money, fame or awards compares to the joy of seeing my mum feel taken care of.

Could never thank her enough but I guess these emo social media reels help a man express himself better...

Happy Mother's Day to every mum out there.

"Punjabis know how to give away their love to the world. 

But who will give us any love? Comment with a ""♥️"" to give love to sweet Punjabi men.

Key word : Sweet.

Our mothers have a tendency to spoil us. 
Fortunately, for most of us, our fathers whack the shit out of.

What separates a good Punjabi guy from a great Punjabi guy are his father's beatings. 

Beatings create ""sweet"" Punjabi men.

Love language? What's that? We do all 6.

- Acts of service.
- Quality time.
- Words of affirmation.
- Physical touch.
- Gifts.
- Cooking elaborate meals for you where each spice and each texture is thought about, to cater to the heavens of your palette babe.

Kohli, Diljit, Aujla, Shubman, Hrithik, Shahid, Ranbir, Guru, Yuvi, you name it. All have one love in common : Chhole bhature.

Hold your hand tenderly with these same hands that are capable of murder. 

Some times, Lord alone knows if we're more warrior or more ""cuddling service professionals"".

"Caption for ""Non-Hindus"" : 

1. ""Hinduism"" is not a religion in the fundamental sense of the word ""religion"".

2. It is a set of philosophies & thought processes. Multiple ancient texts govern how modern Hindus think.

3. There are no strict rules. But as is the case with all faiths, we have our share of extremists as well. 

4. Extremists in my eyes give Hinduism a bad name in the modern day. 

How most Hindus feel : Whether it's Islam, Christianity, Sikhi, Buddhism, Jainism, Judaisam or even the so called ""Pagan faiths"" of tribals... 

You'll always find Hindus who will bow down in respect to all of these. Most of us would be happy to come to your place of worship and bow our head in divine reverence. 

Hinduism, when you study it enough speaks repeatedly about different pathways to the same force we call ""God"".

5. Many Hindus hold pain of the past millennium in their heart. But this pain is fading rapidly with the younger generation. 

Where there is generational trauma, some anger always originates. But for the most of us, we care too much about the present of our nation. We look towards a secular, ambitious future with INDIAN people of all faiths ♥️🇮🇳

6. Study some of our texts for life guidance. Follow all your faith's practices but also GAIN from the gifts of ancient Indian culture. 

In my experience, inter religious studies always improve empathy and the quality of life.

Here are some text names and why they should be studied :

1. Bhagavad Geeta : For psychological and emotional guidance to help you navigate tough times.

2. Garud Purana : For an in depth look into ""after-life"" philosophy. Death is the theme, detachment is the lesson.

3. Tantra Shastra (look up books by Rajarshi Nandy) : For a mind bending journey into ancient India and the reasons behind elaborate prayer rituals. 

4. Autobiography of a Yogi : Yogananda Paramhansa's legendary writings. Will teach you about how you can potentially evolve into a state of higher consciousness in this lifetime itself. Steve Jobs & Virat Kohli's favourite book.

"I've always wondered if men & women love differently.

It is simply a philosophical question that may never actually be answered.

How are men to know the complete truth of a woman's mind? How are women to know the complete truth of a man's heart?

I know for a fact that there are differences in a masculine experience of life and a feminine one.

Biological, psychological, experiential. But what about love? 

Is love different for the two sexes? I don't know. 

What I do know is that most men around me don't know how to handle true love. And hence don't know how to handle true heartbreak.

The only thing that helped me navigate both romance and loneliness were experiences from older men & women. 

I hope that this clip serves the purpose for younger men at least. When I was a boy, I always thought - ""I will not be able to get over this.""

But time & sleep heal. And life makes your heart even deeper.

Life gets sweeter as you age. Just take care of your mind & soul in the now.

Good luck, keep learning. We are born to suffer & grow.

"“Mama I made it to Forbes!” ♥️🥹

Made my mom proud today. Nothing else matters. 

True, raw emotions caught on camera thanks to my profession of vlogging. 

I do have some learnings to share :
- Manifestation & visualisation is cool. But don’t let it take over your mind. 

- I manifested this. But every year that it didn’t happen, made me want to go even harder in the paint! More ferocity. More work. More sacrifices.

- After this clip got recorded, I broke down. Out of happiness and gratitude. But also out of pity for the younger version of me.

- I never celebrated small wins in the chase for one of these type of goals. Today all that will change. 

- If you’re young and ambitious, know that you can never condtrol thde results. You can only control your honesty & integrity in your profession.

- Just do your work to the best of your abilities. And don’t be harsh on yourself if you don’t get to where you wish to be. Try harder the next time but also enjoy each day of your career.

- From today onwards, believe it or not, things have changed. I feel relieved. I feel grateful. I feel free. Only 1 goal left. Without a timeline on it - Build a unicorn.

- The unicorn will be built. But I’m sure as heck going to ENJOY the process. Without a sense of, LETS GET THERE RIGHT NOW. 

- As long as I give it my all, I know God has my back. 

Karmanyava Dhikaraste Maa Phaleshu Kadachana - Only be attached to your sense of hard work. Not to the results that the hard work will bring.

If your parents are proud of you, that’s the biggest achievement.",370938,1895774,3640,1895774,Reel,beerbiceps
"Arjuna : 

1. When you're focusing on the goal, may your eyes trail nowhere else. 

2. Despite immense success & ability, kneel in front of God. 

3. Understand that your success or failure contains many factors that are beyond your control. Be humble and give every day your best.

4. When choosing between ""infinite power of any kind"" & God, choose God. 

5. Lead from the front, lead by example. 

6. Challenge yourself to be incrementally better every day.

7. Be ready to die for your family.

8. Be abled enough to protect them at all costs.

"Dear soul reading this, 
According to numerology, 2024 has been a year governed by Saturn. 

Saturn tests two aspects of your existence : 
1. Your ability to work hard through storms.
2. Your ability to stay humble through glory.

Saturn is a task master. Saturn is an examiner.

It's not been an easy year for me either. I have put my head down and worked through it all.

Some times, while my head was down and working... my eyes teared up with the pressure of being an adult. 

Some times while my head was down and working... God gave me moments to smile & breathe.

It's been a year that's tested me to my last degree of resistance.

It's a year that's taught me : Faith and belief can overcome the false storms of what we call ""suffering""

My knee injury was a gift as much as my national award was.

My poor mental health was a gift as much as public adulation was.

Life's purpose is to grow. Often through the dungeons of suffering as much as through the dungeons of success.

Get even healthier this year.
Meditate deeply this year.
Pursue peace this year.

But whatever you do, believe that God is with you through every step.

Happy 2025, have a blessed one!

"Merry Christmas to you all, from Goa. It's been the most eventful Christmas of my life. 

Gonna be very vulnerable in this write up.

We're perfectly fine & well now. But yesterday at 6:00 pm or so, my girlfriend and I had to be rescued from a bit of a situation.

We both love swimming in the open ocean. I've been doing this since I was a kid. 

But yesterday we got swept away by an underwater current. 
This has happened to me before but I've never been alongside a companion.

It's easy to swim out of one alone. It's very hard to pull someone out with you.

After a 5-10 minute struggle, we called for help and were promptly rescued by a family of 5 swimming nearby.

We're both good swimmers but the fury of nature is such that it WILL test your limits at some point.

A casual, fun dip in the waves was interrupted by an underwater current that toppled both of us. The next thing we knew was that we were both struggling to stay afloat.

There was a point during the ordeal where I swallowed a lot of water and started fading away a little bit. That's when I decided to shout for help.

Deep gratitude to the family of the IPS officer husband and IRS officer wife who saved us both.

This experience left us feeling both blank as well as grateful. We felt the protection of God throughout the incident.

As we moved into today's Christmas, we're simply full of gratitude for being alive.

Almost feel like this one life experience has changed my perspective towards living.

Writing this because I've always shared these moments with you all. Full of emotion and gratitude today. A deep thank you and big hugs to each one of you reading this!

Last evening, I decided to call my brother @brother.salvador to convey the Christmas Eve incident. He performed a prayer for us where we thanked Lord Jesus Christ as well as the God above us. 

This has been a very very memorable Goa holiday for me. From discovering secret Murtis at @aliladiwagoa to touching the life-death barrier.

I guess 2025 is going to be more blessed than ever.

"Dubai dump...

2024 has been painted by challenges & tests from God.

Weirdly it's also been the best career year yet.

This trip marks the end of a very difficult, but rewarding chapter.

At the start of this year, I'd aimed to travel abroad twice for the sake of @theranveershowpodcast.

This was our 3rd podcasting trip of the year. 2024 has been better than we aimed for.

There's only a few days in the whole year when I allow myself to ACTUALLY, TRULY, FULLY feel proud of myself.

Today is that day.

On most other days, even on the fanciest, most flashy days... there's a part of me looking down on my own achievements.

Nothing seems to be enough. Nothing gives me true happiness. No awards, no career highlights, NOTHING.

I am wired to not celebrate. Because I know how much failing has hurt past versions of me.

The less you celebrate success, the less that failure stings when it inevitably happens.

I don't think that this is a healthy mentality for the long term.
But right now, this mindset helps tremendously.

Every year I compete with only one person. 
Me from the previous year.

Fortunately, I've won for 9 years straight. 

Perhaps this year we win the battle of ""work-life-balance"" as well.

Life shouldn't be all about work. 
Intense years should be embraced.
Breezy years should be embraced.

Now we enter our 10th year.

I'm prepared to win & not celebrate again throughout 2025.

But today, we celebrate fully.

Today is a good day because my 2024 shoot schedule comes to an end.

"Happy Diwali! Celebrating this year by announcing a new phase.

This is the first photo shot in our new podcast studio. 
We are entering a ""new season"".
I count this as ""season 2"" of @theranveershowpodcast.

Killing off the old TRS. 
Killing off limitations of the past.

Aiming for a new global identity.
Aiming for futuristic content creation.

India to the world, TRS has gone international.

Thank you so much for all your support, everyone. We're only at half time 😉

Hope this Diwali brings you as much prosperity as you have brought to us this year! 

@teambeerbiceps is deeply grateful!

New logo to be announced soon 🇮🇳🏹♥️

"I've worked my socks off for what I have today.

It's not like we started the podcast and all of sudden we were national news.

Let's rewind a bit :
- Began working as a fitness trainer (went to people's houses to earn money).
- Ran a couple of YouTube channels for 4-5 years before we began the podcast.
- Cofounded a talent management firm called @monkentertainment out of a garage.
- Scaled my content career and business career simultaneously for years.
- Published content every second day for 10 years now. 
- Shot and released close to 900 podcasts.
- Cofounded a profitable tech business called @levelsupermind.
- Going global in YEAR 10 of my journey.

I've lost friends, romances, money, mental health & simplicity trying to get here.

Is this journey meant for everyone? Hell no. I've lived a deeply unbalanced life and I wouldn't wish this reality upon anyone.

I think life should be much more about love, family & spiritual growth than it should be about material progress.

But at this point, I know a story is being written for the history textbooks. I know that what my team @teambeerbiceps is building at this point, will be a case study for future generations.

I can't stop. At least not for a while.

Not everyone is born to be entrepreneurial. This reel is for the misfits, the dreamers & the ones that society calls ""crazy"".

At countless junctures, I've been discouraged, cancelled, hated upon & judged. 

My perpetual lesson has been : Keep carrying on. Think, execute, learn, ask & grow.

If life is hard and the goals are big, you're doing great my friend. Carry on. The suffering of today becomes the strength of tomorrow.

This podcast was shot in Singapore thanks to my dear friend @balajis.

"Another photo dump from the hills. 

Multiple moments from this trip left me feeling liquidised.

Somewhere between the plane of humans & angels & light.

I think this is going to be the place I choose to settle in and raise my family. 

Of course it would be great to continue my career from up here. 

But truth be told, the mountains have a way of leaving you feeling deeply contented.

I've worked really really really hard in the 10 years leading up to 2025.

I've accomplished everything I set out to accomplish. I finally feel (mostly) satiated.

At this point I'm only accepting the city life for the sake of the people who chose to work with me.

We have to see our mission through and I jolly well know that we will. Everyone who has put in the years will build generational wealth for their families.

But as for me, I just want to get lost in these other worldly colours. 

One day a lemony gold sunset to kiss me goodbye.

The other day, a saturated rainbow to make me feel like a 4 year old again. 

Then a moment of deep rest (perhaps ego death), by the side of a sapphire blue stream. 

And finally, a reminder from a mountain Goddess (this time Chamunda Maa)... telling me, ""Son, give this girl with you the best that you have to offer...""

We return to the city life albeit for 12 hours. 
Tomorrow, we go to Singapore. 

Age 31 leaves another 9 years of war ahead of me. 

Kangra, Dharmsala & McLeod Ganj will have to wait for a bit. But I will be back soon to my dearest Himalayas 🏔️🏔️🏔️

"Don't let society's matrix fool you into thinking that money matters more than love.

Money is fantastic. And can genuinely enhance the life of your loved ones. 

But that's why I believe in working very hard during the earlier phases of one's life.

Life can't be about making money forever. 

Use the power of compounding cash and compounding repute to build more ""TIME WEALTH""

We don't earn to become rich. We earn to become free.

Focus on building memories. 
Focus on maximising moments.
Focus on the parts of life full of love.

And if you can't afford these luxuries yet, focus on making your dreams a possibility.

When you wish to give up, remember that you're doing it for the smiles on your loved ones' faces.

"August photo dump with a cute story. 

This is Khwaab. 
She came up to me when I was shopping and asked for a photo!

She said, ""Yeh woh podcast uncle hai!""

This was the youngest TRS fan I ever come across!

Truth be told, I've been going through a very difficult year.

I don't get too much time to myself and step out very rarely. When I'm out in public, I've reached a stage where I wish to be as private as possible. 

If I'm out with my mum or girlfriend, I simply wish to hold their bags and be Ranveer. Not beerbiceps...

Of course I'm grateful to anyone who comes up and conveys love. But I've also had many situations where people come up and convey criticism, judgement or generally speaking : dark energy.

I guess when one makes it mainstream, the experience of life gets altered slightly...

No complaints, this is what I signed up for. I can't have a normal experience of life if I'm releasing 4 podcasts a week 😂

Khwaab came up to me without any kind of hesitation.

I felt like her presence melted away my tough day, tough year & tough exterior...

The photo you see is my best moment from that day! And quite easily one of the best moments of the year.

Thank you @khwaab__artwani 🤍🤍🤍🤍

In a torrential ocean that I call life, moments like these stabilise the ship that I call my heart...

The other photos are other happy highlights from this past month : 
- my loved ones. 
- some achievements.
- some epic meetings with epic souls.

2024 : One of the toughest years of my life. But life is still joyous.

This year, the skill I worked on the most : Learning to extract maximum happiness from the little joyous moments of life. Mindfulness combined with gratitude combined with imperviousness.

"Thoughts I've had about having children :

1. Perhaps having kids is the 4th most important aspect of a human birth. The others being :
- Spiritual growth.
- Taking care of your parents
- Giving back to society, through your work.

2. I'm sure that the birth of your kids makes you more responsible. But maybe it also makes you relive your childhood. And therefore makes you dive deeper into your own psyche.

3. Spiritual growth is definitely accelerated if you protect & raise a child. Living for the sake of another human being is one of the greatest things that one can do in a human birth.

4. One needs to be financially, spiritually and biologically ready to bring life into this world. Be aware of ""responsibility"", before multiple duties become your reality.

5. Having progeny is your chance at the propulsion of your value system into the future. If your kids make the world a better place, you have done your bit for society. 

6. Considering where world population demographics currently stand, many believe that a couple should produce more than 2 children. Personally I want more than 2 kids. But not at the cost of the quality of fatherhood I can provide. Time will tell...

7. As I age, I love my parents more with every passing year. I also realise that I carry generational trauma & tendencies that I've inherited from my bloodline. Fatherhood will be my test. What am I passing on to the next generation? What tendencies or trauma will be held back from reaching them?

All I can do now is work on being the best version of myself.

---

Every stage of adult life throws new challenges your way.

If you put your mind to it, you'll become better annually.

Study about fatherhood.
Study people's mistakes.
Visualise a warm reality.
Prepare for responsibility.

"Sometimes, you realize you are living a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity—one where you meet and interact with a true legend in person. I had the privilege of meeting @kondavishweshwarreddy sir, a distinguished leader who has held prominent roles such as CEO and MD at Wipro HCIT, MD and Director at Citadel, MD and CEO at GE Healthcare, and is currently serving as a Member of Parliament with the BJP.

What fascinated me even more was discovering that, back in 1985—before I was even born—he was a computer science faculty member at the New Jersey Institute of Technology and Essex County College. Engaging with someone of his vast experience is a unique opportunity for learning, and I took full advantage by asking countless questions about his teaching and research. His insight into the future of technology and where humanity is headed is nothing short of extraordinary, and I found myself in complete agreement with his perspectives.

Here’s a quick glimpse of my remarkable experience with him. Thank you, Sir, for your valuable time during @bsidesahmedabad

OSCP is among one of the toughest exam in hacking world. It’s a 48 hour continuous grind and clearing it in one attempt is not easy. 
Mentorship is not writing every line of code or showing every technique by hand. It’s about keeping you on track, make YOU to learn. 
Ultimately it’s your success that feels a teacher happy.
