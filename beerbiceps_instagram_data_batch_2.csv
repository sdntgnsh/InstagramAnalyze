"Dharamshala photo dump. 
Aka photos from an inner & outer healing journey.

So much has happened in Dharmsala that I can't possibly put it into a single caption. All I'll say is the following :

Spent years spending long days, 
Waiting to fall asleep,
For my life was harsh & sombre, 
Until I found your mystique...

Now my days are bright & rainy,
A lonely past they do replace.
Now my sleep, no matter how warm.
Is left behind for the prettiest face.

Don't know how to thank you more deeply?
There's so much I wish to give you!
You're the rain & clouds for my dry greenery.
You're the healing my heart feels with you.",309519,,627,,Carousel

"9 years of BeerBiceps. I now enter my 10th.

At the beginning of my career, my mind was full of ideas, but my heart was full of self doubt. 

It took delusion, shamanic healing, meditation, books, mentors, therapy & luck to get this far.

Somewhere along the way, a false sense of self belief was born in me. I took this ""false self belief"" & executed upon ideas incessantly.

Eventually, my team and I started receiving public adulation as well as growth in numbers. The false self belief turned into real self belief. 

The 9 year journey has perpetually been about execution. Perhaps only to feel better about myself and my capabilities.

The highs have never been celebrated enough or enjoyed completely. That is just how I believe a true warrior should live life. It may simply be a mechanism that protects one over time.

The lows have always been met with grief, heightened discipline & harsher self talk. It has not been an easy journey for me. 

There's definitely a part of my mind and heart that feels torn apart and shredded thanks to the stories of the last 9 years. 

But there's also a part of me that's trying to become more 'still' with time. 

More detached. More process driven.

I tell myself that I'm born to be a GOAT.
I tell myself that I'm born for an infinitely long journey of improvement.
I tell myself that sadness, pain & strife can't pierce my heart.

All of the above 3 lines are lies. 

But they help me carry on. 
They help me focus on the week at hand. 
They help me get better every year.

In my head, I'm already the GOAT I wish to become. In my heart, I feel the bruises of years of negative self talk.

But I carry on with the biggest lesson I learnt from Yogananda Paramhansa : Wake up every morning with faith in God & a warrior spirit. No difficulty can beat the bravery within a spiritual heart.

Samurai mentality : Detachment, constant improvement & ferocity in execution.

Now... it's time to reinvent 🕷️

Thank you for the support over the last 9 years. Onto bigger things.

There are ""places your soul visits"".

And then there's ""places that visit your soul.""

For seekers : Ican't even begin to explain what awaits you in Banaras.

The less I say the better. Visit at some point soon. Understand Kaal Bhairav.

All I'll say is this :

Met a smart kid called Kushagra.

He asked me, ""How do people in other cities NOT pray to God? How do they take care of their minds? Don't they feel anxious or weak? I can't imagine a life without this degree of spiritual energy in the air.""

All I said is, ""Brother, you've earned your birth in this city. Consider yourself lucky.""

Been a year that's had extremely high highs. 
Been a year balanced out by terrible lows.

I've come to realise that the questions that matter are :
- Are you getting better at being a human being? 
- Are you becoming a more helpful professional?
- Are you doing your best for your family?
- Are you doing your best for your body?
- Is my girl secure & taken care of?
- Is my team motivated & calm?
- Am I okay battling the world?
- Am I meditating deeper?
- Am I kinder every day?

The answer in all cases should be 'yes' or ""I'm going to get it done.""

"The Buddha was once approached by a man who said, ""I want peace.""

To which the Buddha replied, 
""Remove 'I' to remove the ego. 
Remove 'want' to remove desire. 
You are left with peace.""

Easy in theory, difficult in practice.

But 31 years of living on this planet have taught me a few key lessons :
1. There is no end to life's challenges & aches. Pain is compulsory & suffering is optional.

2. The way your mind processes suffering can be drastically changed if ""spiritual practices"" are a central theme in your life.

3. Meditating, journaling & manifesting are modern & 'cool' alternatives to deeper, more ancient practices.

4. These deeper practices are often rejected by modern humans because they seem to be ""illogical"" or ""orthodox"".

5. Every religion contains evil humans that manipulate other people into accepting twisted forms of rituals under the garb of religion. Knowledge is power. Protect yourself by questioning everything. Move forward with a ritual if it makes sense to YOU.

6. Before jumping to conclusions about rituals of ANY faith, always try experiencing those rituals yourself. Replace judgement with curiosity.

7. Rituals if done with understanding & emotion can be a much more powerful spiritual practice than you'd think!

In this video, my elder brother and mentor @om.dhumatkar is conducting a Hanumana havan for @teambeerbiceps in our office. 

Immensely powerful experience because everyone was vibrating on the same frequency. This 2 hour havan (along with its explanations) left us all feeling purified & enhanced.

Unfortunately I had to sit on a chair because I've torn my knee ligament. But when the heart contains love & respect, the ritual allows for a tiny bending of rules (ideally I should have been on the floor.) 

Love growing older because of experiences like this. 

Healing more every year, Aum Hum Hanumate Namaha!

"About 9 days ago, I tore my ACL during a football match. 

Had only read about how intense a knee injury can feel until I experienced it myself. Happened very randomly when a brother tripped & fell on me during a game.

Heard a pop in my knee and knew immediately that it was something serious. The physical pain kept building up over the next 2-3 days. Fortunately, I began immediate sports Physiotherapy with my saviour @drdivyacures!

Been consistent with my physio routine throughout these 9 days. And the pain is decreasing rapidly.

Currently on the road to recovery and likely dodging the need for a surgery.

I've now realised how important one's knees are. Until you experiences a knee injury (God forbid), you'll never know how mentally challenging this can feel.

Imagine not being able to wear your pants yourself. 
Imagine not being able to sit cross legged. 
Interrupted sleep at night.
Fear induced limping.

It's getting better rapidly but man... my mental health has crumbled in this 1 week. 

Was finally able to sit on a chair for an extended period only yesterday (day 8). Had a deep meditation session after what felt like forever. 

Feeling so much calmer again. Trying to give myself as much positivity as possible. Trying to escape all forms of self pity. And most of all, trying to get back to being in better shape than I ever was 🙏🏻

Life will always throw curve balls your way. Better to stop questioning the lows as early as possible. 

Even better : Respond to low phases with ACTION & with a LEARNING MINDSET. 

Shoutout to everyone who has gone through knee injuries man. This shit fire for all the wrong reasons. 

Shoutout to you if you're going through any physical or mental 'injury'.

Keep fighting, keep rising 🙏🏻♥️",119287,1269288.0,886,1269288.0,Reel
"9 practices that have helped me increase my sense of detachment :

1. Read an immense number of spiritual books. The more wisdom you absorb from the minds of sages, the less society's shortcomings will bother you.
- Autobiography of a Yogi
- Doorways To Light (Krishnananda)
- Ancient Science Of Mantras (Om Swami)
- Any book by Rajarshi Nandy

2. Worked really hard at my material career from early on. The quicker your material needs are taken care of, the sooner your consciousness travels to the realms of what's beyond human limitation.

3. Meditating daily. To begin, use @levelsupermind.

4. Conversations with (much) older people. Eventually you realise that only regrets & relationships matter. And beyond the realms of regret & relationships lies the realm of divinity. In the ultimate end, only your equation with divinity matters.

5. Travelling within India. Yes it's chaotic. Yes, it can be slightly unhygienic. But if you're willing to go beyond these obstacles, you will find consciousness elevating geographies in places like Banaras, Rishikesh, Vrindavan & many more.

6. Not celebrating victories for too long.

7. Constantly visualising a life without :
- My favourite foods.
- My favourite activities.
- My loved ones.
- My physical capabilities.
- Money, success & adulation.

8. Living a life without any intoxication. Giving up alcohol in 2018 was a game changer for me. Giving up meat around the same time was an equally big game changer.

9. Using sadness to write or create. Using happiness to convey joy to others. Perceiving both simply as tools rather than as states of the mind. Because even thoughts should NOT be taken seriously. They are not in your control. 

The only thing in your control is your perception of your thoughts & life.

"9 things to know about ""Siddhis"" : 

1. Some version of ""Siddhis"" or 'divine abilities' is spoken about in every religion in the world. 

2. In the modern day, very few humans adopt a disciplined spiritual path. Hence a very small percentage can even experience powerful ""Siddhis"" being blessed upon them. 

3. In Hinduism, Siddhis are considered roadblocks or obstacles even though they might seem positive on the surface. A ""superpower"" may be exciting in the beginning but its purpose is to test your determination to get to the ultimate goal - Union with the divine. 

4. The more you meditate/pray, the closer you get to achieving the goal you were sent here for. When one is bestowed with a Siddhi, their ego may get inflated. Siddhis are the divine's method of testing your humility and intentions.

5. Siddhis and many aspects of spirituality are beyond the limits of where science has currently reached. Absence of evidence should never mean an evidence of absence. Skeptics will never be convinced about further human evolution. Perhaps they're not yet meant to climb the ladder of spiritual evolution. Step 1 : Be open. 

6. The heightened ""calmness"" or ""focus"" that's scientifically proved by studies on meditation is only the first, tiny version of what ""siddhis"" truly are. 

7. They should not be your motivation. But they will definitely help boost your material prospects. 

8. If you pray/meditate for the sake of material growth, you will likely not gain siddhis because you'll likely not go far up the ladder.

9. Read ""Autobiography of a Yogi"".

"Tore my ACL on Sunday.

Was feeling heaps of self pity & sadness.

No sports for 3 months and lots of therapy to recover...

And just when I was at my lowest, my life as a podcaster woke me up again.

Today we shot with Major DP Singh.

A Kargil War veteran who lost his leg while protecting one of India's posts in South Kashmir.

He's lived without 1 leg (and an old ACL injury on his other leg) for 25 years. 

He's become a marathon runner.

He's achieved multiple world records.

Travels across the country motivating people with stories of hope. 

Absolutely infectious, positive warrior energy.

Really want my knee to recover soon. But days like this don't come your way randomly.

I truly believe that they're sent to you by the universe. To remind you that life is about much more than just your physical (& mental) body's limitations.

Today's strangely poetic meeting was a reminder for me.

I remembered a Bruce Lee quote that I'd go back to a lot while starting off my career : 

""The mind that perceives the limitation, is the limitation.""

Some random thoughts I've had lately :

1. Maybe I should leave all this and truly retire into solitude.

2. Too many great people work with me and I owe them the love & faith they've put into my story.

3. Can't retire until my guys & girls are more than taken care of.

5. My love for family increase every year but my free time possibilities constantly reduce.

6. Marriage will be about lots of free time. Balance then means a bit of imbalance now.

7. I need to get closer to my deity. I need to dive deeper into my spiritual disciplines. More sadhna. More challenging anushthaans.

8. Eventually, God is planning my entire journey. I have to work on constant improvements in humility and routines.

9. I miss my friends. I miss when I had more than just a Sunday to myself... But this is God's plan for 2024.

10. Everything that I prayed for is becoming mine thanks to God's will. Do I even want kids & marriage? Or do I simply want God next? I don't know.

And it's okay to not know.

Just give every day your best shot...

"This reel isn't just for my mum. 

It's for every mother out there who is sacrificing for the sake of her child. 

One can never value a mother enough until one sees a bit of life. Unfortunately this usually happens post age 25.

So if you're a mom who is working hard for your child's future, just know that ONE day... it's all going to be worth it. 

Thank you for what you do, moms. 

For many of us, we're not able to express it, but every day is Mother's Day. 

For those of you who don't know yet, Sunday is Mother's Day. Do something special for her. 

And for those of you who don't get along with your mum for whatever reason, remember... parents are also growing up along with us. 

Forgive her for what you may hold against her, she knows she's not perfect. 

But she's always going to try to do better. Motherhood is not easy, help her out by simply giving her your TIME regularly. A phone call, a deep conversation, a tight hug.

Go make peace with your mum if that is what your soul is telling you to do. 

But if you're already at peace with her... then please pamper the heck out of her. At least on this weekend.

For me, there's only one reason to give every day my best shot. And that reason is my first love, Dr. Swati Allahbadia.

No joy from money, fame or awards compares to the joy of seeing my mum feel taken care of.

Could never thank her enough but I guess these emo social media reels help a man express himself better...

Happy Mother's Day to every mum out there. 

Paeri pauna, maa ♥️

"HE HESITATED.

If only for a brief 5-10 minutes during his shave.

“Kya aap apni shave ke baare mein sochte ho?”

My life may be intense. Gruelling. Death grip oriented. 

Every podcast is a ball I must hit out of the ground.

But every pre podcast shave. Oh every easy going, juicy stroke of my razor...

It’s between shaving & meditation for me now... thanks to the smoothness and comfort mei khaas Gillette Mach 3. 

So good that it makes me hesitate...

"Punjabis know how to give away their love to the world. 

But who will give us any love? Comment with a ""♥️"" to give love to sweet Punjabi men.

Key word : Sweet.

Our mothers have a tendency to spoil us. 
Fortunately, for most of us, our fathers whack the shit out of.

What separates a good Punjabi guy from a great Punjabi guy are his father's beatings. 

Beatings create ""sweet"" Punjabi men.

Love language? What's that? We do all 6.

- Acts of service.
- Quality time.
- Words of affirmation.
- Physical touch.
- Gifts.
- Cooking elaborate meals for you where each spice and each texture is thought about, to cater to the heavens of your palette babe.

Kohli, Diljit, Aujla, Shubman, Hrithik, Shahid, Ranbir, Guru, Yuvi, you name it. All have one love in common : Chhole bhature.

Hold your hand tenderly with these same hands that are capable of murder. 

Some times, Lord alone knows if we're more warrior or more ""cuddling service professionals"".

I guess only our wives will know...

So ladies, choose wisely, choose Punjabi.

Shoutout to my main man @imkalera for the ear worm of the year. Boomshakalaka Punjab Kings, everyone's second team thanks to their brotherly Punjabi friends.",298506,2932699.0,4878,2932699.0,Reel
"Caption for ""Non-Hindus"" : 

1. ""Hinduism"" is not a religion in the fundamental sense of the word ""religion"".

2. It is a set of philosophies & thought processes. Multiple ancient texts govern how modern Hindus think.

3. There are no strict rules. But as is the case with all faiths, we have our share of extremists as well. 

4. Extremists in my eyes give Hinduism a bad name in the modern day. 

How most Hindus feel : Whether it's Islam, Christianity, Sikhi, Buddhism, Jainism, Judaisam or even the so called ""Pagan faiths"" of tribals... 

You'll always find Hindus who will bow down in respect to all of these. Most of us would be happy to come to your place of worship and bow our head in divine reverence. 

Hinduism, when you study it enough speaks repeatedly about different pathways to the same force we call ""God"".

5. Many Hindus hold pain of the past millennium in their heart. But this pain is fading rapidly with the younger generation. 

Where there is generational trauma, some anger always originates. But for the most of us, we care too much about the present of our nation. We look towards a secular, ambitious future with INDIAN people of all faiths ♥️🇮🇳

6. Study some of our texts for life guidance. Follow all your faith's practices but also GAIN from the gifts of ancient Indian culture. 

In my experience, inter religious studies always improve empathy and the quality of life.

Here are some text names and why they should be studied :

1. Bhagavad Geeta : For psychological and emotional guidance to help you navigate tough times.

2. Garud Purana : For an in depth look into ""after-life"" philosophy. Death is the theme, detachment is the lesson.

3. Tantra Shastra (look up books by Rajarshi Nandy) : For a mind bending journey into ancient India and the reasons behind elaborate prayer rituals. 

4. Autobiography of a Yogi : Yogananda Paramhansa's legendary writings. Will teach you about how you can potentially evolve into a state of higher consciousness in this lifetime itself. Steve Jobs & Virat Kohli's favourite book.

"Key 2024 lesson this :

Some of my craziest podcasts till date have been with top Indian cybersecurity professionals.

Most people have no idea about the modern and innovative ways used by scammers to take away your hard-earned money. 

We can keep our money safe by being aware of the methods used by scammers and also share this information ahead to help others as well. 

Learning more about cyber thefts and security is now a modern day skill.

Do watch our cybersecurity TRS episodes and stay aware of the dangers around you.

A richer India also must be a more aware India!

"I've always wondered if men & women love differently.

It is simply a philosophical question that may never actually be answered.

How are men to know the complete truth of a woman's mind? How are women to know the complete truth of a man's heart?

I know for a fact that there are differences in a masculine experience of life and a feminine one.

Biological, psychological, experiential. But what about love? 

Is love different for the two sexes? I don't know. 

What I do know is that most men around me don't know how to handle true love. And hence don't know how to handle true heartbreak.

The only thing that helped me navigate both romance and loneliness were experiences from older men & women. 

I hope that this clip serves the purpose for younger men at least. When I was a boy, I always thought - ""I will not be able to get over this.""

But time & sleep heal. And life makes your heart even deeper.

Life gets sweeter as you age. Just take care of your mind & soul in the now.

Good luck, keep learning. We are born to suffer & grow.
